+ What is ioredis?
ioredis is a Node.js library that provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface for interacting with Redis, a high-performance in-memory data structure store. It supports advanced Redis features like pipelines, clusters, and pub/sub, making it suitable for a variety of use cases such as caching, real-time data, and message brokering.


+ What is Bull?
Bull is a Node.js library for managing queues backed by Redis. It simplifies the creation of background jobs, processing tasks, and managing job lifecycles. Bull integrates seamlessly with Redis to ensure reliability and scalability.


Redis Queue in the Context of Email
A Redis queue is used to handle tasks asynchronously by adding them to a queue and processing them in the background. For email functionality:

Queue Creation:
Add email details (e.g., recipient, subject, body) to a Redis queue.

Background Processing:
Workers pull tasks (emails) from the queue and send them using an email service like SMTP.

Benefits:
Ensures non-blocking, scalable operations for tasks like sending large batches of emails.
Handles retries and delays efficiently.


How ioredis and Bull Help with Redis Queues

- ioredis: Provides the connection and operations for interacting with Redis.
- Bull: Uses Redis (via ioredis) as a backend to manage and process queues, offering built-in features like retries, delays, and concurrency.
