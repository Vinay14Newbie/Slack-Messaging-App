Redis, with its support for list and set data structures, can be effectively used as a message queue. This means that it can handle multiple tasks that are lined up for processing. The tasks can be processed either immediately or at a certain scheduled time. The ability to use Redis as a queue opens up a wide range of possibilities for handling distributed jobs and messages, especially in applications that require high performance and reliability.

A "Redis queue to send mail" refers to using Redis, an in-memory data store, as a message queue to temporarily hold email data before sending them out, allowing for efficient batch processing and decoupling the email sending process from the initial action that triggers the email, thus improving application performance and scalability; essentially, instead of sending an email immediately, you add it to a Redis queue, and a separate worker process then retrieves and sends the emails from the queue one by one.
